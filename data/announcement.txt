<p>Hey everybody, welcome to the new year!!! New year, <strike>new Namit (pls)</strike>. With the announcement from UW about in-person classes, weâ€™ve decided to have our Winter break jam showcase be held online. If you want to show off your game or have an officer play it for you, please fill out the attached form. Remember that even if you sign up, you can choose not to present your game if you change your mind later on. (but pls dont; we wanna see it TwT) We will be meeting this Wednesday at 4:30 pm PST in the More 220 voice channel. We hope to see some awesome games!
