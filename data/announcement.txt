<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>We are in the final stretch of the quarter! Before we all go off on our finals, we have one last weekly meeting! You’ll want to stop by this time because we squeezed in a guest talk from WWU sister club member Wyatt!!</p>

<p>Wyatt will be going over the MDA framework--another means of analyzing games!</p>

<p>What’s more, this meeting will also be the BIG REVEAL for our three new GDC officers! Stop on by #More220 at 4:30pm pst to meet them!</p>

<p><em>- Cameron, President</em></p>
