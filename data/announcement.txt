<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>This week is gonna be pretty chill since it's the start of midterm season, we're having a guest speaker Korray from Epic Games, from the Animation Programming team, come and give a talk about what he does and what happens in industry. To be a bit more detailed, he plans to go into the architecture of animation programming, so be ready to hear some new stuff and learn! This is not a tutorial, just a talk about the details on animation programming fyi. Same time, same place, More 220 @ 4:30pm, hope to see you all there (gl with midterms).</p>

<p>PS: Our game jam is coming up soon and with that said, we're going to start our game jam theme voting! We feel that giving more freedom to the themes helps create more games! Later in the week we'll post a form to submit game jam themes, be on the look out!</p>
