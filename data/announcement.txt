Hey everyone!
</p>

<p>
The theme suggestions closed today for this quarter’s game jam, hopefully you got in your suggestions! Voting for the theme is open now and will be closed during this Wednesday’s meeting. Form link: <a href="https://forms.gle/3kuaQk78Xo9syf3YA">Link</a>. You can vote for as many themes as you want but only once.

During this week’s meeting, Game Dev Club Alumni Britt will be coming down to give a talk about his game Troupes Tail and the game dev opportunities available over the summer for fellow game dev members looking to help with Troupes Tail’s development and get some game dev experience.

After that, we will be announcing the game jam theme and officially starting our new two-week long game jam. Have fun, it’s GAME JAM TIME!
