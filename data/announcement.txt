<p>Lots of stuff to get into in this one so get a chair. First and foremost, I gotta tell you about the awesome Music Talk being given in #More220 for this week's 4:30pm meeting. Ben will be giving insights into how he approaches making music for games, so definitely be there if you are a programming one-trick-pony like myself who is looking to branch out a bit!</p>
<p>Currently, the ongoing situation prevents us from holding any in-person :person_doing_cartwheel: showcase events this quarter. This is a shame, given the  all of the quality games I've seen being built recently. As such, we have two ways to get even a little bit of outside exposure for these games:</p>
<p>Firstly, there is the GDC website, which you can get your game and link to your personal page onto using this form: <a href="https://forms.gle/b16iDKm8z1idNZmu6"target="_blank">Game Showcase Form</a> We actually have a pretty decent domain name for this website that people looking for game development at UW are likely to come across in a simple google search. It is definitely an underutilized resource in our club for getting exposure.</p>
<p>The second resource we have is provided in collaboration with WGA :video_game: . They are looking to do a weekly Content Creator Hightlight :flashlight: featuring members of the UW community who create any type of creative content. The highlight will include a twitter post from their 3000+ follower account, so this is an absolutely fantastic way to get your games out there; apply here</p>

<p>Outside perspective is key in iterating on your games, so I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO PUT ALL YOUR GAMES, NEW AND OLD, THROUGH BOTH OF THESE FORMS</p>
