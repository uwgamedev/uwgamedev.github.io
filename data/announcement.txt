<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>We're gonna step back from the code this week for a more game design focused talk! Get your dodge rolls ready for a boss battle design talk!</p>

<p>I'll hope to tackle what makes an interesting boss fight, and also some tips on designing a boss of your own (which could help for our future game jam)!</p>

<p>Speaking of the game jam, we're doing theme voting again! Go check out <a href="https://forms.gle/MxvSckZgYqjTvH9Z6" target="_blank">this form</a></p>

<p>Reminder the game jam will start on the 26th!</p>

<p>As always we'll be in #more220 at 4:30!</p>
