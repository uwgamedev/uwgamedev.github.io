<p>Quick reminder that the <strong>beginner/intermediate tutorials</strong> are happening THIS WEEK (Wed, 4:30 pm pdt, #220 channels). As these tutorials run pretty long, we ask that everyone comes to the tutorial with the required software pre-installed.</p>

<p><strong>If you are doing the Unity (beginner) tutorial:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download" target="_blank">Download Unity hub</a></li>
	<li>Within Unity hub, download the latest version of the Unity editor</li>
	<li>Ensure that you install Visual Studio+Unity tools for it when installing the editor</li>
	<li>Make sure to launch the editor at least once (to let it perform initial startup tasks)</li>
	<li>Launch Visual Studio from within Unity</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are doing the Godot (intermediate) tutorial, your job is <em>a bit</em> easier:</p>
<a href="https://godotengine.org/download/windows" target="_blank">Download and install the standard version of godot</a>
<br>
