<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>We’re going to take two pages out of the 12 principles of animations, specifically squash & stretch, and anticipation. No drawing skills are required for these two animations, you don’t even have to know how to draw perfect circles! Aseprite is a beginner friendly pixel art software that is great to start on to learn about animations. Make sure you download <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/trial" target="_blank">Aseprite</a> (you can get it for free) and get your Unity engines running. Get hyped for the last talk for the quarter!</p>

<p>Hello everyone, </p>

<p><s>Bob Ross</s> Thomas here, back with another episode of how to not fail at digital art! I’ll be talking about my experience learning to make good art, and then spend the rest of the time doing a live drawing session!
If you want to follow along, most the techniques discussed will be applicable to any sort of drawing software, but the one we’ll be using is Clip Studio Paint, which you can get a free trial for here: <a href="https://www.clipstudio.net/en/purchase/trial/" target="_blank">link</a>. However, you can use any drawing software like Krita.
DRAWING TABLET STRONGLY RECOMMENDED (You can use a mouse but you may not get the same results)</p>
