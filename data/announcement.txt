<p>Coming up this Wednesday, I'll be turning the club into a jam session (not the game kind) and showing off the basics of Bosca Ceoil!</p>
<p>It's gonna be a time to chill out and I can show my process on how I make music.</p>

<p>Tune into GameDevClub radio in More 220 at 4:30 PST this Wednesday</p>
<p>If you want to try Bosca Ceoil out for yourself before the meeting you can get it for free from here: <a href="https://boscaceoil.net/">Bosca Ceoil</a></p>
