Hey @ everyone, the school year is almost over but we still have a few more things planned. This Wednesday, weâ€™re going to have a guest speaker, Ben Hayes, a former game designer for Magic: the Gathering at Wizards of the Coast and currently a design director at Second Dinner. He will be delivering a talk on game balance. Feel free to come with questions in mind. Same place, same time, MEB 234 @ 4:30pm on Wednesday. Hope to see you guys there.
