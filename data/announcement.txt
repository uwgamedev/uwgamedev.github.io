<p>Hey everyone. Hope you all had a great three day weekend.</p> 

<p>This weekâ€™s meeting will be about baking (no cakes). A sort of watered down explanation for baking is that you are storing details (as PNGs mostly) of your texture for a model for use in other 3D softwares. I will be using Blender for this tutorial. The 3D model used for baking should be available to you guys by Wednesday. As usual, a mouse is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Reminder: The officer applications are still open! Feel free to give it a shot, they will be closing at the end of THIS week (25th February). Link to the form: <a href="https://forms.gle/GUhyY22TWYpnFQDg7">Apply</a></p>

<p><em>- Namit, Officer</em></p>
