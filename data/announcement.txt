<p>Once again I just want to thank everyone for such a great year of Game Dev Club. It was fun getting to meet a lot of you, see what projects your working on, and watch you learn and grow as game developers. As a club, this was probably are strongest year, and that was thanks to you guys. Make sure to keep us updated with what you are working on over the summer and I hope to see you all next year!</p><p><em>- Jose Pacio, President </em></p><p>Looking for weekly happenings?
