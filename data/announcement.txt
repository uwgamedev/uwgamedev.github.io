<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>Hello, everyone, we’re finally back in-person this year. Again, welcome back to returning members or welcome to new students joining us this year. So upcoming this Wednesday, we will be having our first meeting of the year, in-person, at More 220 at 4:30 PM-5:30 PM. This meeting will be mainly social and give everyone the opportunity to get to know one another (we have the room till 6:30 PM!). If you don’t come, we’ll find you</p>
