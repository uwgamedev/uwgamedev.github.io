<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>A quick reminder that this Wednesday will be a Design Bytes meeting, meaning that you have the opportunity to rant about your (most/least) favorite games and their design! Yes, that is right! We are opening the floor for design byte roasts (in which you point out games that have bad design decisions)

<p>On an unrelated note, a number of GDC officers will be retiring in the next quarter or two. This means new officer spots are opening up, and you can apply <a href="https://forms.gle/D1h192G1ttxQK6ySA" target="_blank">here</a> to become one!</p>

<p><em>- Cameron, President</em></p>
