<p>Ludem Dare not enough for you? Get HYPED for the upcoming Game Jam starting <i>this Friday,</i> the 24th in the More220 channel at 5pm. There will be virtual pizza and a theme to get those creative game juices a flowin'.</p>

Simply fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/5wMVTgzvmWimMbAt7" target="_blank">this linked form</a> <b>if you want a group and do not have one</b> and our expert officers will do our best to match you with your ideal partner(s) in crime!
