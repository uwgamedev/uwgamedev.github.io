<p>Heyo Gamers!</p>
<p>Time to let you know about next week’s meeting! This week we’re going to be giving a demonstration of using the UNITY ANIMATOR! Wooooo animation, so cool. We’ll specifically be using the animator for 2D animation this meeting since 3D is super scary. We’ll also be giving you a quick introduction to unity packages by using DoTween, a nice way to do quick animations without the animator.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Esauidk/GDCAnimatorTutorialAssets" target="_blank">GitHub</a> I’ve prepared some assets for you guys to use during this meeting. I recommend you wait till meeting day before downloading, since more files might be added.</p>

<p><em>Don’t worry guys, non-technical talks are coming your way in the future</em></p>


<p>ALSO! We have a form for you to fill out! Want some game dev club merch???? Fill out this form so we can get an estimate on how many want some! <a href="https://forms.gle/a4SwukejN5Z4wQgt6" target="_blank">Google Survey Form</a></p>
