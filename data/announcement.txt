<p>Hello everyone! It's time for Game Dev Club to start meetings again! </p>

<p>October 3rd, we'll be having our first meeting for the quarter! Come on down to <b>More 221 at 4:30pm</b> and have a blast with yours truly, the other officers, and other game dev club members. We'll share what we have planned for this quarter, what we do in general, and some past projects we've worked on! We'll also have time to show off anything you've worked on in the past, over the summer, or just want to get feedback on!
</p>
<p>
NEW MEMBERS/PEOPLE WHO WANT TO JOIN THE CLUB:
There really isn't much you need to do to join, just come on down to the meeting and we'll get you set up! We take all experience levels!
