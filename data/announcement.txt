<p>Multipart announcement coming in hot!!
1. This week’s talk will be a juice talk, given by former GDC president Andrew! For those of us who are #outoftheloop, game juice is a term used amongst club members to refer to a class of enhancements you can apply to your game to quickly make it look and feel more polished and fun! It is a longstanding game dev tradition that we hold this talk, so definitely tune in at the regular time (Wed, 4:30 pm, #More220 channel)</p>

<p>2. The quarterly game jam is just around the corner, and is happening November 6th-8th! </p>

<p>[pssst… a game jam is like a hackathon; you are given a theme and a weekend to create a new game start to finish (in a team or solo)]</p>

<p>See graphic for more details!</p>
