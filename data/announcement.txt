<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>Happy Monday! Hope you’ve been soldiering through the midterms these past few weeks. At this week’s Wednesday meeting (at 4:30 pm in the #More220 voice channel), I will be giving a genre analysis talk on roguelikes/roguelites and their variants. They’ve certainly seen success commercially in recent history, so good to think about what they are, and why they are fun!</p>

<p>Hope to see you there,</p>

<p><em>- Cameron, President</em></p>
