<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>We’re going to take two pages out of the 12 principles of animations, specifically squash & stretch, and anticipation. No drawing skills are required for these two animations, you don’t even have to know how to draw perfect circles! Aseprite is a beginner friendly pixel art software that is great to start on to learn about animations. Make sure you download <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/trial" target="_blank">Aseprite</a> (you can get it for free) and get your Unity engines running. Get hyped for the last talk for the quarter!</p>
