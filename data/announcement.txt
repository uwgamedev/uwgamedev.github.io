<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>What’s up gamers . We had a great turn out last week and it was cool so see so many new faces and some returning faces. This Wednesday will be one of the most important meetings of the quarter: our beginner tutorial. I will be teaching everyone how to make a simple 2D platformer. So, this Wednesday we will need you to bring a laptop with Unity  installed (just get the latest version), a code editor of your choice (Visual Studio, VS Code , notepad++, etc. ), and preferably a mouse (please don’t hurt yourself by not having one).</p>
