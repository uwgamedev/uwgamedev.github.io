<p>Hey Gamers,</p>
<p>Hope the end of the quarter is going well for y’all. This week we’ve got an art talk/workshop coming up (given by yours truly). I’m gonna be talking a little bit about theory but mostly we’re gonna be in the drawing software experimenting and making your own stuff! It’s not gonna be a traditional tutorial where you gotta squint at the screen and try to keep up for two hours so come chill and hang and color :D Make sure to bring some sort of drawing software on your device (preferably Krita; it’s free! But you can also bring CSP, Photoshop, Procreate, or any others just not GIMP >:( ) Here’s a download link for Krita:</p>

<p>As we talked about 2 weeks ago, we will be doing a Winter break game jam. This one will be special as it will be 2 weeks long and the showcase will be the first week back in Winter Quarter. Here is the theme submission form:</p>

<p>We will close this form during dead week’s meeting (12/8) and then we will open up the voting form.</p>

<p>Lastly, as a reminder, we still have the club t-shirt submission form going on for another week. We will be closing it on 12/8 before meeting, where we will show off the designs and vote for our favorite design. Here is the form again:</p>
