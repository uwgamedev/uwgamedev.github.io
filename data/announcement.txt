Hey everyone! We have acquired a <b>new meeting location: MEB 234!!!</b> (still Wednesdays at 4:30 PM)
</p>

<p>
This week’s (April 6th) presentation will be an “Introduction to Godot”:
<ul>
  <li>How does it work?</li>
  <li>How do you organize a project??</li>
  <li>What are scenes and resources???</li>
  <li>How do you incorporate your assets????</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
All this and more will be answered! :tada: It will be a mix between a slideshow and you trying things out on your own computer. Bring your computer with Godot installed so that you can fully participate (64 bit, standard version): <a href="https://godotengine.org/download">https://godotengine.org/download</a>
