<p>Hey everyone</p>

<p>Hope everyone is settling into the quarter! This week will be an assorted genre analysis talk; we have three of our favorite genres that our speakers will present on:

<p>Sandbox, given by Arif</p>
<p>Shooters, given by Namit</p>
<p>Metroidvanias, given by Roberto</p>

<p>As always, the talk will be given during this Wednesdayâ€™s meeting at 4:30pm in the #More220 voice channel.</p>
