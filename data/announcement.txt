<p>The third meeting of the quarter will be taking place in the discord server as per usual in the MORE220 voice channel. We will be giving an informational talk on version control and the basics for what you'll need to know if you wanna work collaboratively online or just have a cleaner workflow. The online quarter is the perfect time to learn about version control. VC software like Git help you collaborate online by allowing multiple people to edit copies of a project and then upload those changes to a master project. Since we will be covering things like Git and GitHub, so if you haven't already you can install Git using the link below.</p>
