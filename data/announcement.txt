<p>Just wanted to remind everyone that this is the week of the quarterly game jam (starts Fri, Nov 6th at 5pm in #More220). To get y’all prepared for the jam, us officers have prepared a Jam tips n’ tricks presentation that you can tune into on Wed, Nov 4th in the same place as usual. 

If you want to participate in the jam, but don’t want to do it alone/need a team, you can fill out this form <a href="https://forms.gle/3iKqoVzEbSQ3uT1g9">https://forms.gle/3iKqoVzEbSQ3uT1g9</a> to get matched with a balanced team of fellow club members. Just make sure to act fast, as we will be closing this form Thursday night so officers have time to do the sorting and notify the teams!</p>

<p>[pssst… a game jam is like a hackathon; you are given a theme and a weekend to create a new game start to finish (in a team or solo)]</p>
