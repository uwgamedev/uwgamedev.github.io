<p>Hey everyone! How is the game jam going so far? The weekend is almost over but you can continue to work on the game till Wednesday before the start of the meeting! (Cheatersâ€¦ - Esau)</p>
<p>Make sure to bring your games! (USB drive, itch.io or your computer)</p>

<p>Update on T-Shirts. We have gauged that there is enough interest in a club T-shirt, so we will proceed in the creation of one. Based on the survey, most people would like to do a design contest for the T-shirt. So, we have linked a submission form down below. Submissions will be open now until 12/1. There are no real limitations (other than keep it PG-13) on how the design can be, so let your imaginations run wild!</p>
