<p>This week (Oct 16th) will be a meeting dedicated to getting you prepped for the upcoming game jam! We'll be covering a lot of handy tips and tricks when it comes to making games in a short timeframe. I highly encourage attending the game jam, it's the fastest way to become a full fledged game developer. As always, see you at <strong>More 220 at 4:30pm</strong>!</p>
