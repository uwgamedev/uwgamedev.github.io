<p>Attention @ everyone! An update from your friendly neighborhood officers:</p>

<p>Unity is DEAD. From now on, Unreal is the new way. Everyone must report to the weekly meeting (in #More220 4:30 PST Wed) for --reeducation-- a helpful tutorial on Unreal blueprints, given by new officer Namit.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know, Unreal blueprints are a node-based system for creating game logic, enabling you to make a game entirely without programming! If you are an artist/musician/etc who couldn’t be bothered to do programming before, this would be a good one to try!</p>

~~Context Switch!~~

Also coming up <em>next</em> week is the quarterly game jam :gamejam:! As is tradition at this point, we are opening up a form for y’all to submit theme ideas. Submit as many as you wish <a href="https://forms.gle/Lcv4mbtCkP7EwKbLA" target="_blank">here</a>
