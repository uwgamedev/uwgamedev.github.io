Hey everyone!
</p>

<p>
We have a couple announcements to go through today. First off, for this Wednesday’s (April 13th) meeting, due to the positive feedback on
last quarter’s game dev challenge/workshop, we will be doing another one. The theme of this one will be “level design”. So throughout the
normal meeting time (MEB 234 from 4:30pm - 6:30 pm), your goal will be to create a playable level and it’s up to you how complex and
interesting it can be. You can work off of an existing project or you can use one a base platformer project provided by us. You can find
them at <a href="https://github.com/Esauidk/GameDevLevelDesignChallenge"> this link</a> (won’t be ready until the meeting).
</p>

<p>
If you don’t want to participate in the challenge, you can instead spend the time as a workshop instead where you can work on a project
and get feedback/help on improving it. 
</p>

<p>
Second announcement, we will be having our quarterly game jam soon. This time however, we’re changing things up. Based on feedback, instead of a
weekend-long jam, we are now switching to 2-week long game jams. The game jam will begin on Wednesday 4/20 during meeting time. For now, we will be
releasing the theme submission form. It will be open until the following Sunday, so get those ideas in.
