<p>Hey everyone, the end of the quarter is quickly approaching already. Unfortunately, this week, we will not be having a meeting, so feel free to relax this Wednesday. Instead, the officers will be focusing on conducting officer interviews. So, if you applied to be an officer, you will receive some information about that very soon. Hang in there everyone, we're almost done.</p>
