<p>Hey <b><em>GAMERS</em></b>, we are in the final stretch of the quarter! The next meeting will be the last one of the quarter and we our gonna end it with <b><em>P I Z Z A</em></b>!
Besides pizza, we’ll play some Jackbox stuff and Smash Bros. Feel free to join us in More 220 for some pizza and games.</p>

<p>As we talked about 3 weeks ago, we will be doing a Winter break game jam. This one will be special as it will be 2 weeks long and the showcase will be the first week back in Winter Quarter. Here is the <a href="https://forms.gle/RXP7SM31xnDaVxTf9" target="_blank">theme submission form</a>.</p>
We will close this form during the dead week’s meeting (12/8) and then we will open up the voting form.</p>

<p>Also again, we still have the club t-shirt submission form going on until 12/8 before the meeting, where we will show off the designs and send out a form to vote for the best design. Here is the <a href="https://forms.gle/J5jif8FfS9EcXhJz9" target="_blank">form again</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, we are releasing a <a href="https://forms.gle/asaBfi3qX45Hf1bMA" target="_blank">feedback form</a> so that you guys can help us improve for the upcoming quarter. It will be super helpful for us and for you if you could take some time to fill it out!</p>
