<p>WASSUP everyone!</p>

<p>3 weeks left! Spring Quarter is almost done! What weighs more, a ton of feathers or a ton of steel? They both weigh a <b><em>single ton</em></b>! The past two meetings have been design talks and we’ve decided to do a quick technical talk on SINGLETONS. Some of you probably already know what a singleton... For others that don’t know come and check it out! This talk will be presented by either the Camel or the Hollow Knight shiller himself, Esau! Either way, be prepared to learn about them! Wednesday @ 4:30 in More 220, be there or be a square.</p>
