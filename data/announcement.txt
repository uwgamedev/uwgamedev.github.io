<p>Hey Gamers! Hope y'all are doing fine on this third week online, sadly we’re still operating online :(. We will keep you guys updated as the weeks go by and UW releases any news. Luckily this week's meeting works well with this online format. Based on feedback, we know that last quarter it was hard to follow along with the tutorials and many of you might be confused with the main components of Unity. We’ll be covering them in this week’s talk with a more clear exploration of Unity fundamentals. Not a follow along this time.</p>
