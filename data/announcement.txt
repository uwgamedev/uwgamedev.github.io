<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>That break sure felt short, yet here we are again at the start of another beautiful online quarter!</p>

<p>As the quarter winds up, reminder that the first week of the quarter has no weekly meeting. This means that the first official meeting of the quarter will be next Wednesday, 4/7 at 4:30pm.</p>

<p>As a democracy, we want your votes to make better talks this quarter. We’ve included a <a href="https://forms.gle/cpBTXYrLjYMgviiw5" target="_blank">form</a> asking about what sorts of talks you’d like to see for Spring quarter. Anyone who does not respond will be hunted down and forced to use discord light mode!!</p>

<p><em>- Cameron, President</em></p>
