<p>Hey GAMEEERRRRRRSSSSSSSSSSSZSZZZZZZ! (Esau stopped me from doing a normal greeting)
Hopefully you all had a great weekend working on the game jam! This Wednesday we will be doing the showcase. If you have not finished working on your games then you can *technically* work till 4:30 on Wednesday.</p>

<p><b>Reminder: The new meeting room is in MEB 103 at 4:30 PM</b></p>


<p>Make sure you bring your game either on your computer, have an itch.io link, or some sort of external storage so anyone can play it. Also, make sure you bring a HDMI adapter if your laptop does not have an HDMI port.</p>

<p>Looking forward to those games!</p>

<p><em>Please bring a game</em></p>


<p><em>- Namit, Officer</em></p>
