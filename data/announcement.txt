<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>Hear that? That’s the sound of another rockin’ quarter (rumblin’ in) coming your way!!</p>

<p>Stop on by for our first weekly meeting of the quarter, which is in the #More220 voice channel this Wednesday at 4:30pm pst. Stop on by to learn more about the club, some opportunities, and break the ice with club members!</p>

<p>The icebreaking activity will be some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1583910/Tic_Tac_Together/" target="_blank">Tic Tac Together</a> bonding time! If you weren’t around for one of our recent meetings, Tic Tac Together is an awesome party game developed by former club members Jose and Andrew, getting released next month (5/11) on Steam</p>

<p>Feel free to check them out on Steam and maybe give them a wishlist to support club alumni</p>
