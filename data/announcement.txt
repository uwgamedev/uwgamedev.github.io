<p>Hey everyone! Itâ€™s almost February >.>, we are still online but hopefully we will go in-person in the week after. Just like the last meeting, this one is also a tutorial so it should work well over Discord.
This time I will be giving an intro tutorial to Blender. I will go through the process of making a basic weapon model from start to finish. Highly recommend that you guys use a mouse for this one. Baking is not gonna be covered so if you guys are interested in a tutorial on that, please let us know!</p>

<p>One last update, the 2021-2022 t-shirts have arrived! We will be handing them out at our next in-person meeting which will hopefully be the NEXT next Wednesday (2/2/22), but we will have to see what UW decides. If you are unable to pick them up in person, please dm one of the officers and we will work something out.</p>
