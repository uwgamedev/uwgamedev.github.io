<p>This week (Oct 9th) will be our beginner tutorial for the quarter! We'll be teaching how to make a platformer with Unity! Please come with Unity (any version 2017 or later) pre-installed. It will take too long to do right before the meeting. Please also bring a mouse if you can since trackpad dev sucks. As always, see you at <strong>More 220 at 4:30pm</strong>!</p>
