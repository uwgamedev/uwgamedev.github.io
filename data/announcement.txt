<p>Hello everyone! The jam is over and all the games showcased were super cool!</p>

<p>So far we had only technical tutorials but we are moving on to the artsy side with Texture Painting. I will go over how you can give your 3D assets some Texture. I will use Quixel Mixer to do the texture painting and Iâ€™ve already modelled the 3D asset in Blender and baked with all the required maps (more on this during the tutorial). I recommend you bring a mouse and unfortunately Mixer is not supported on Linux (sad penguin noises). You can find links to the assets in our Discord.</p>

<p>The T-shirt design contest continues, we have linked a submission form down below. Submissions will be open now until 12/1. There are no real limitations (other than keep it PG-13) on how the design can be, so let your imaginations run wild!</p>
