Hey everyone!
</p>

<p>
Hi everyone! Hopefully the game jam progress has been going well. We have a few things to announce. This week will be pretty chill. This Wednesday will just be a progress check/work time session, so feel free to stop by @ 4:30 in MEB 234 if you want to work on your games or get feedback on what you currently have.</p>

<p>The other thing we wanted to talk about is Husky Expo. It is happening this Saturday (30th April) at the HUB. Weâ€™ll be tabling there from 12PM to 4PM in the HUB South Ballroom, so feel free to stop by and say hello.</p>
